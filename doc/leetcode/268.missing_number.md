# 268. Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:
```
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## 思路
用数学知识解决，所有数累加起来，得到一个 sum，由于数列是连续的，且缺少了一个，那么就可以用求和公式得到总和 sum2，sum2 - sum 就是结果。
